# A-LOAM
## Advanced implementation of LOAM

A-LOAM is an Advanced implementation of LOAM (J. Zhang and S. Singh. LOAM: Lidar Odometry and Mapping in Real-time), which uses Eigen and Ceres Solver to simplify code structure. This code is modified from LOAM and [LOAM_NOTED](https://github.com/cuitaixiang/LOAM_NOTED). Compared with origin code, this code is more clean and simpler without complicated mathematical derivation and redundant operations. It is a good learning material for SLAM beginners. It may be more accurate and stable than any other implementation you can find on github.

**Modification:**

1. Replace complicated mathematical operation by Eigen and Ceres Solver. No Euler angle, no derivation any more.
2. Remove useless and redundant operation. The code structure is clean and readable.
3. Support Velodyne 64 on KITTI.

## 1. Prerequisites
### 1.1 **Ubuntu** and **ROS**
Ubuntu 64-bit 16.04 or 18.04.
ROS Kinetic or Melodic. [ROS Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)


### 1.2. **Ceres Solver**
Follow [Ceres Installation](http://ceres-solver.org/installation.html).

### 1.3. **PCL**
Follow [PCL Installation](http://www.pointclouds.org/downloads/linux.html).


## 2. Build A-LOAM
Clone the repository and catkin_make:

```
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/A-LOAM.git
    cd ../
    catkin_make
    source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

## 3. Velodyne VLP-16 Example
Download [NSH indoor outdoor](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s05tBQOLNEDDurlg48KiUWxCp-YqYyGH/view) to YOUR_DATASET_FOLDER. 

```
    roslaunch aloam_velodyne aloam_velodyne_16.launch
    rosbag play YOUR_DATASET_FOLDER/nsh_indoor_outdoor.bag
```


## 4. KITTI Example (Velodyne HDL-64)
Download [KITTI Odometry dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php) to YOUR_DATASET_FOLDER and set the `dataset_folder` and `sequence_number` parameters in `kitti_helper.launch` file. Note you also convert KITTI dataset to bag file for easy use by setting proper parameters in `kitti_helper.launch`. 

```
    roslaunch aloam_velodyne aloam_velodyne_64.launch
    roslaunch aloam_velodyne kitti_helper.launch
```

## 5. Docker Support
To further simplify the build process and be environment independent, we add docker support in our code. After [docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/), you can build docker image by (may need `sudo` depends on your configuration):
```
cd docker
make build
```
The build process may take a while depends on your machine. After that, launch rviz by `rviz ../rviz_cfg/aloam_velodyne.rviz`, followed by command `./run.sh 16` or `./run.sh 64` to run A-LOAM (again you may need `sudo`).
